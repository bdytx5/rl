# Assignment 1
This assignment is a easy one, corresponding to lecture 1 and lecture 2, which runs under the modified [frozen_lake](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/)([source code](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/frozen_lake.py)) environment of [Open AI gym](https://gym.openai.com/). You better learn the course slides scrupulously and do the written homework first, which guarantees you fully understand the algorithm.  
***Notes:*** 
> I have modified some codes of the original version assignment mainly because I thought these codes were wrong. I have annotated for these modified parts.
