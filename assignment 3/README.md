# Assignment 3
This assignment is a little bit hard, corresponding to lecture 8 to lecture 10(Policy Gradient I,II,III), 
which runs under the  
[CartPole-v1](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/)[discrete], 
[InvertedPendulum-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/InvertedPendulum-v2/)[continuous], 
[HalfCheetah-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/HalfCheetah-v2/)[continuous], 
3 different environments of [Open AI gym](https://gym.openai.com/). 
You better learn the course slides scrupulously and do the written homework first, 
which guarantees you fully understand the PG algorithm.  
***Notes:*** 
> I have modified the `__main__` codes of the original version `pg.py` to make the PGAgent work on `CartPole-v1` environment 
directly, because I don't have the `Mojoco Licence`(so expensive!) which is required when using other two continuous environments.
